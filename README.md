# My_projects
I post here each cool project that I do:

## Arithmetic_Formatter
It formats operations as students in primary school do.
## Time_calculator
It is able to add hours and minutes to a specific time. It also shows the number of days that passes from the starting time to the final time.
## Budget_app
You can create a lot of categories, that are similar to a wallet. You can deposit into them, withdraw from them and transfer from one of them to another one.
There is even a function that creates a chart that shows as a percentage how much money has been withdrawed from selected categories.
## Hat_Probability_Calculator
